<p>
	Welcome to our website! We are the Beta Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. We were founded on December 10, 1899 at City College of
	New York by a handful of brave men who came together to form a society of men from all backgrounds, particularly Christian and Jewish, an
	unprecedented and bold act for the time; these values of diversity and acceptance still serve as our foundation to this day. Our individual
	chapter at the University of Missouri was formed in 1927 by 32 men brought together by our fraternity values, symbolized by our motto of
	"Better Men. Better Lives." In the years following our chapter has closed multiple times for different reasons, but you can now find us on
	campus in Greek Town at 805 Richmond Avenue, Columbia MO 65201, of which there is a picture at Christmas time below. We have around 160
	members, making us one of the largest fraternities on campus and the largest chapter of Delta Sigma Phi nationally, but we also pride
	ourselves on the brotherhood and other great things we promote at Delta Sig. Here you will be able to find information on our history,
	brotherhood, and philanthropy, as well as being able to submit a profile to send to our recruitment chairman.
